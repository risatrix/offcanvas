offcanvas
=========

Originally, I had the idea of making this an off-canvas menu plugin. Inspired by David Bushnell's [article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/15/off-canvas-navigation-for-responsive-website/), My reasoning was simple: given that an off-canvas menu
usually requires bundling up all the other content, it wouldn't be that hard to make a plugin that wrapped the content for you, then inserted an offcanvas menu by taking the content from whatever was already there.

As I played with it, I started to worry about acessibility issues, and whether or not it was truly able to made into a one-stop plugin. So, rather than continuing that, I've been iterating on the offcanvas menu, first on my personal blog, then on the Texas Tribune microsite, then on the Tribtalk.com site.

I may return to it eventually, because I still like the idea.
